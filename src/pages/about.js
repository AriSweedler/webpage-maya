    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>
      <b>Hello</b>, my name is Maya Sweedler.
    </p>

    <p>I’m a reporter currently searching for opportunities in journalism — preferably something that involves diving into public records and flexing my multimedia skills. I’m fascinated by the vagaries of the criminal justice system and the complexity of the modern political economy. </p>
    <p>I honed my breaking news chops at the Los Angeles Times, where I covered the 2018 midterm elections, and the Wall Street Journal, where I spent a summer covering topics ranging from Florida’s red tide to Manhattan’s underground drone races. My work has also been published in The Seattle Times, where I wrote about naughty pirates as the David Boardman investigative intern, and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.</p>
    <p>Born and raised in Silicon Valley, I moved back east for college and fell in love with the idea of having four seasons. I graduated from Yale in May 2018 with a degree in history. However, I spent most of my time in college at the Yale Daily News, Yale’s award-winning daily newspaper, where I served as managing editor. Prior to that, I covered sports and dabbled in data-driven reporting and graphic design.</p>
